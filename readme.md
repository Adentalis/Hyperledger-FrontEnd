# Hyperledger FrontEnd

This is the Front End Application for my Hyperledger Programm

This is build with Node.js and Express and is using the "new" css grid technology

The FrontEnd can be downloaded by everyone but in order to get or update data in the blockchain you need the right bearer token wich have to be updated every 24h.

Only I have the rights to get a new valid bearer token :)
